<p>Greetings! ðŸŒ»</p>
<p><br>
    We are a group of students, pursuing MA in Psychology from the University of Delhi. As a part of our academic
    research project, we are conducting an experiment to examine decision making under uncertainty and the role of
    personality in it.
</p>

<p>
    <br>
    The experiment consists of two phases â€“ <b>passive and active phases.</b> During the <b> passive (training
        phase), </b> you are required to attend to the relationship between your score and the image that follows
    your score. <b>Active phase </b> will follow at the end of the passive phase. During active phase, you are
    required to
    use what you learned of
    the relationship between your score and different images that follow it. You will be given a choice between two
    gambles and out of those two choices you will be required to choose the option that you think will maximize your
    score.
</p>

<p><br><b> As a participant, the overall aim is to maximize your score. </b></p>
<p><b> Out of the top scorers, three will be given cash prizes as follows:</b></p>
<p><b> 1st prize will be Rs 1500</b></p>
<p><b> 2nd prize will be Rs 1000 </b></p>
<p><b> 3rd prize will be Rs 500 </b></p>

<p><br>
    We request you to participate as honestly as possible
</p>
