    With the score accumulated in the passive phase, you will play gambles composed of the same images. In each trial,
    you will be presented with two of the images that you have learned about in the passive phase. By pressing the
    buttons in the scanner to move a cursor, you now have the option to choose to either: a) Accept gamble one, in which
    case you will be assigned one of one set of two images, or. . . b) Accept gamble two, in which case you will be
    assigned one of another set of two images.
